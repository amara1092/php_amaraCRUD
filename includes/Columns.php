  <div class="col">  Streetwear is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s.[1] It grew from California surfskate culture and New York hip hop fashion to encompass elements of sportswear, punk and Japanese street fashion. Eventually haute couture became an influence.[2] It commonly centers on "casual, comfortable pieces such as jeans, T-shirts, baseball caps, and sneakers", and exclusivity through intentional product scarcity.[3] Enthusiasts follow particular brands and try to obtain limited edition releases.[4][5]</div>
  <div class="col">Streetwear style is generally accepted to have been born out of the Los Angeles surf culture and New York City hip hop culture of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Early streetwear in the 1970s and 1980s also took inspiration from the DIY aesthetic of punk, new wave, heavy metal and hip hop, co-opting established legacy sportswear and workwear fashion brands such as Schott NYC, Dr. Martens, Kangol, Fila and Adidas.</div>
  <div class="col">In the late 1980s, surfboard designer Shawn Stussy began selling printed T-shirts featuring the same trademark signature he placed on his custom surfboards. Initially selling the items from his own car, Stussy expanded sales to boutiques once popularity increased.[6][7][8] Then as sales peaked, St√ºssy moved into exclusive sales to create product scarcity, which firmed up the ultimate baseline definition of streetwear: T-shirts and exclusivity."[3]
